# Harshad-Number-Generator
This project was apart of my second standardised coding assessment, I had to create an algorithm to find all Harshad numbers up to any given positive integer. Here is the completed version of my code, and an explaination of what a Harshad number is.

A Harshad Number is a positive integer which is exactly divisible by the sum of its digits. The first twelve Harshad numbers are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 18. 36 is also a Harshad number as the digits of 36 are 3 and 6; the sum of these digits is 9 as 3 + 6 = 9 and 36 is exactly divisible by 9 (36 / 9 = 4). 15 is not a Harshad number as the digits of 15 are 1 and 5; the sum of these is 6 and 15 is not divisible by 6.

My objective is to write a programme that asks the user to enter a number, n, and then calculate and display he nth Harshad Number. For example if 12 is entered then the previous 12 numbers listed before should be shown. I am to assume the user will always enter a positive integer.
